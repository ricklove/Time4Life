# Version 1

## Hour 1

### 2014-05-28 6:20-6:25 Plan

- What is the most important thing to accomplish this hour?

	I want to setup the basic project structure:

	- as an HTML5 app hosted online using GitHub and Git2Site to publish online 
	- and as native apps using Marmalade Web to test, deploy, and publish

### 6:25-6:45 

- Create an empty HTML5 project

### 6:45-7:15

- Define the EnterValueStatements feature

### 7:15-7:25 Summary

- Define next tasks
- Write Summary:

	I set up the project and defined the first feature. 

	I also improved my working process in various small ways:

	- I started with an empty project and will not have any unintended junk added by accident
	- I simplified the Notes 
		- (I still need to think about how to contribute to a developer's blog in process)
	- I ensured to start with feature definitions first 
		- (I have not done the benefit's analysis yet - but the benefits are obvious to me for this project)
	- I added plan and summary to this work hours to help maintain intentions

## Hour 2

### 8:41-8:48

- Restructure this WorkHours file
