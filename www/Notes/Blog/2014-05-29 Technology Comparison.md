### Comparison

The Time4Life app will be a comparison of the following technologies:

- HTML5 online web app
- HTML5 offline web app
- PhoneGapBuild (HTML5 Hybrid with Prebuild Plugins)
- CocoonJS (HTML5 Hybrid with Prebuild Plugins)
- Web Marmalade (HTML5 Hybrid with Prebuilt Plugins and manual C++ Marmalade Plugins)
- Xamarin (HTML5 Hybrid with Prebuilt Plugins and manual C# Plugins)
- Xamarin.Forms (C# with Xamarin.Forms UI)
- Xamarin.Forms 2 HTML5 (.net PCL to Typescript using  and Xamarin.Forms to Knockout)
	- Netjs .net to Typescript compiler https://github.com/praeclarum/Netjs
	- Xamarin.Forms 2 HTML5 (I will create this project and implement as much as needed)


All Solutions will be tested on Android using an Amazon Kindle Fire HD.

Each solution will be measured in terms of development effort (initial Setup of tools will be noted, but not measured).

Also, the last solution will be of my own creation which was inspired by the release of Xamarin.Forms in Xamarin 3. 
I look forward to that solution as the answer to a single-source code that is deployable at high speeds natively, 
but can still be demoed online.
