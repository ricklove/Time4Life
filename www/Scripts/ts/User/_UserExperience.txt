## [Page:LifeValues] Life Values

Begin by considering what is really important in your life:

- At the end of your life, what will you look back and say were the best parts? 
- What is really important to you? 
- What do you wish you were spending time on more?

<Text(Answer)> List some of your life values (Enter one per line)

<Button("Next")> Next (Go to $[Page.Next.Label])


## [Priorities] Priorities

Now, consider which of your values are most important:

- Of the list of values that you entered, which is the most important? 
- Which values should you spend more time on?
- Which values should you spend less time on?

<OrderableList (LifeValues.Answer.Lines)> Sort your life values by importance (Use the up & down buttons to sort your life values by importance)
	

<Button("Back")> Back (Go back to $[Page.Previous.Label])
<Button("Next")> Next (Go to $[Page.Next.Label])

## [Time] Time

Now that you have ordered your values, consider how much time you should be spending on each.

- How much time should you spend on this value during the day?
- Are there some days you should spend more time on this value?

@TimesPerDay{
	5 minutes
	15 minutes
	30 minutes
	1 hour
	2 hours
	4 hours
	8 hours
}

@TimesPerWeek{
	1 day
	2 days
	3 days
	4 days
	5 days
	6 days
	every day
}
