## Hour 1

### Plan

What is the most important thing to accomplish this hour?

I want to setup the basic project structure:

- as an HTML5 app hosted online using GitHub and Git2Site to publish online 
- and as native apps using Marmalade Web to test, deploy, and publish

### 6:20-6:45 

- Complete hour 1 plan
- Create an empty HTML5 project

### 6:45-7:15

- Define the EnterValueStatements feature

### 7:15-7:25

- Complete Hour 1 Summary

### Summary (5+50+10)

I set up the project and defined the first feature. 

I also improved my working process in various small ways:

- I started with an empty project and will not have any unintended junk added by accident
- I simplified the Notes 
	- (I still need to think about how to contribute to a developer's blog in process)
- I ensured to start with feature definitions first 
	- (I have not done the benefit's analysis yet - but the benefits are obvious to me for this project)
- I added plan and summary to this work hours to help maintain intentions

## Hour 2

---
# FUTURE

- Complete benefits analysis

- Include the testing framework
- Create the EnterValueStatements feature tests
- Extend the testing framework to load feature files and compare them to the written tests to make sure all features are being tested
- Implement the EnterValueStatements feature
